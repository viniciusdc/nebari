# Usage

## Local Deployment

### Environment Variables
To deploy QHub set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` and create a new sub-directory running:
```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
mkdir -p data
```

### Initialize configuration
Then, initialize the configuration file `qhub-config.yaml` with
```shell
python -m qhub init local --project=projectname --domain github-actions.qhub.dev --auth-provider=password --terraform-state=local
```

#### Generate user password
Each user on the `qhub-config.yaml` file will need a password. You can use [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) to
generate a salted password by using the following python script:
```python
import bcrypt;

bcrypt.hashpw(b'<password>', bcrypt.gensalt())
```
Where `<password>` can be changed to any value.

TODO: describe this section more precisely. Where should the script be imported? Any exceptions for password characters?

### Render config file
Next, we will render the files from `qhub-config.yaml` running
```shell
python -m qhub render --config qhub-config.yaml -f
```

### Deploy modules

And finally, to deploy QHub:
```shell
python -m qhub deploy --config qhub-config.yaml --disable-prompt
```

To ease the development, we have already pointed the project's DNS record `jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev` to the IP address 
`172.17.10.100`.

To make sure all is correctly set, check the load balancer IP address:
```shell
$ > ip route
```

In case the address does not correspond to `172.17.10.100`, point the DNS domain to the address by running
```ini
172.17.10.100 jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev
```
### Verify deployment
Finally, if everything was set properly you should be able to cURL the JupyterHub server with
```shell
curl -k https://jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev/hub/login
```

It is also possible to visit `https://jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev` using the web browser to check the deployment.

### Cleanup
To clean up the installation use the command
```shell
python -m qhub destroy --config qhub-config.yaml 
```
Followed by 
```shell
minikube delete
```
The commands will delete all instances of QHub, cleaning up the deployment environment.

## Cloud Deployment

Once all environment variables have been set, you will be able to run commands on your terminal to set QHub's deployment.

### Initialize configuration
There are several ways to generate your configuration file. You can type your commands according to the terminal prompts,
or you can set it all automatically from the start. In any case, we advise you to start by creating a new project folder.
Here, we will name the new folder `qhub-test`.

On your terminal run:
```shell
mkdir qhub-test && cd qhub-test
``` 

#### Fully automated deployment
To generate a fully automated deployment, on your terminal run:
```shell
qhub init aws --project project-name --domain jupyter.qhub.dev --ci-provider github-actions --oauth-provider auth0 
--oauth-auto-provision --repository github.com/quansight/project-name --repository-auto-provision
```
The command above will generate the `qhub-config.yaml` config file with an infrastructure deployed on `aws`, named 
`project-name`, where the domain will be `jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev`. The deployment will use `github-actions` 
as the continuous integration (CI) provider, automatically provisioned and authenticated by `auth0`, initialized on 
GitHub under the URL `github.com/quansight/project-name `.


There are several **optional** (yet highly recommended) flags that allow to configure the deployment:

+ `aws` indicates that the project will be deployed on the Amazon AWS Cloud provider.
- `--project`: project-name is required to be a string compliant with the Cloud provider recommendations (see official Cloud provider docs on naming policies).
  + `jupyter.qhub.dev` is the domain registered on CloudFlare. In case you chose not to use Cloudflare, skip this flag.
- `--domain`: base domain for your cluster. After deployment, the DNS will use the base name prepended with `jupyter`, i.e.
  if the base name is `test.qhub.dev` then the DNS will be provisioned as `jupyter.test.qhub.dev`. This pattern is also applicable if you are setting your own DNS through a different provider.
- `--ci-provider`: specifies what provider to use for CI/CD. Currently, only supports GitHub Actions.
- `--oauth-provider`: This will set configuration file to use the specified provider for authentication.
- `--oauth-auto-provision`: This will automatically create and configure an application using OAuth.
- `--repository`: Repository name that will be used to store the Infrastructure-as-Code on GitHub.
- `--repository-auto-provision`: Sets the secrets for the GitHub repository used for CI/CD actions.


### Render config files
This file will handle the creation of all Terraform modules for the QHub infrastructure.

After initializing, we then need to create all Terraform configuration. This done by running the local command:
```shell
qhub render -c qhub-config.yaml -o ./ -f
```

This will create the following folder structure:
```
.
├── environments        # stores the conda environments
├── image               # docker images used on deployment: jupyterhub, jupyterlab, and dask-gateway
│   ├── dask-worker
│   ├── jupyterlab
│   │   └── __pycache__
│   └── scripts
├── infrastructure      # contains Terraform files that declare state of infrastructure
└── terraform-state     # required by terraform to securely store the state of the deployment
```
        
### Deploy QHub

Finally, we can deploy QHub with:
```shell
qhub deploy -c qhub-config.yaml --dns-provider cloudflare --dns-auto-provision
```

The terminal will prompt to press `[enter]` to check oauth credentials (which were added by the `qhub init` command). 
That will trigger the deployment which will take around 10 minutes to complete.

Part of the output will show an "ip" address (DigitalOcean or GCP), or a CNAME "hostname" (for AWS)
according to the Cloud service provider. Such as:

+ Digital Ocean/Google Cloud Platform
```shell
    ingress_jupyter = {
            "hostname" = ""
            "ip" = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
            }
```
+ AWS:
```shell
    ingress_jupyter = {
    "hostname" = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
    "ip" = ""
    }
```
        
### GitOps
QHub uses a GitHub Action to automatically handle the deployment of the infrastructure. For that, the project must be 
pushed to GitHub. Using the URL under the `--repository` flag on the `qhub init` command, set the CI/CD changes to be triggered.

To add the project to the initialized GitHub repository run:
```shell
git add .github/ .gitignore README.md environments/ image/ infrastructure/ qhub-config.yaml  terraform-state/
```

Push the changes to the repository:
```shell
git push origin main
```

Once the files are in Github, all CI/CD changes will be triggered by commits to main, and deployed via GitHub actions.
Since the infrastructure state is reflected in the repository, this workflow allows for team members to submit pull 
requests that can be reviewed before modifying the infrastructure, easing the maintenance process.

To automatically deploy:
- make changes to the `qhub-ops.yaml` file on a new branch. 
- create a pull request (PR) to main.
- Trigger the deployment by merging the PR. All changes will be automatically applied to the new QHub instance.

Congratulations, you have now completed your QHub cloud deployment! :tada
