# Testing

## Modifying Docker Images

All QHub docker images are located in [qhub/templates/{{
cookiecutter.repo_directory
}}/image/](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-cloud/tree/main/qhub/template/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.repo_directory%20%7D%7D/image). You
can build any image locally. Additionally on PRs each docker build
will be tested.

```shell
docker build -f Dockerfile.<filename> .
```

## Local Testing

Local testing is a great way to test the components of QHub. While it
does test most of everything it does not test cloud provisioned
components such as the managed kubernetes cluster, vpcs, managed
container registries, etc.

This guide assumes that you have the QHub Cloud repository downloaded
and you are at the root of the repository.

### Dependencies

In order to develop with QHub you will need to download the following
dependencies and have them available in your path.

 - [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
 - [minikube](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

---
**NOTE**
  Qhub-cloud currently runs `Terraform 0.13.5` which can lead to some incompatibility
  if you install a newer version of it. In order to avoid such situations you can 
  download the `Terraform 0.13.5` binary from [releases](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.13.5/)
  and move the downloaded file to `~/.local/bin`. Be sure to add it to your path 
  `export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` if it's not already added.

### Initialize kubernetes cluster

Testing is done with minikube. Note that this will download a ~500MB
docker image.

Note: The testing instructions mentioned below works well on Linux. They
don't work very well with Mac OS at the moment, due to the
[limitations of docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds),
the primary limitation being Docker Desktop for Mac can’t route traffic
to containers. It should be possible to achieve these with hyperkit driver
with minikube, but it has not been tested yet.

Before running the code below, be sure to have installed the docker [driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). 
Also to save yourself time after the install add yourself to the docker 
group by executing `sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`.

To confirm successful installation of both Docker and Minikube, 
you can run the following command to start up a local Kubernetes 
cluster:
```shell
minikube start --cpus 2 --memory 4096 --driver=docker
```
Once Minikube start finishes, run the command below to check the 
status of the cluster:
```bash
minikube status
```
If your cluster is running, the output from minikube status should 
be similar to:

```bash
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
timeToStop: Nonexistent
```

After you have confirmed Minikube is working, you can continue to 
use or you can stop your cluster. To stop your cluster, run:
```bash 
minikube stop
```
### Configure the `metallb`

The jupyterlab instances require mounting nfs pvcs. This requires
nfs-common drivers be installed on the nodes themselves. For that, 
please ensure `nfs-common` is installed in the cluster:

```shell
minikube ssh "sudo apt update; sudo apt install nfs-common -y"
```

Configure the `metallb` load balancer to have a start ip of
`172.17.10.100` and an end ip of `172.17.10.200`. These ips were not
randomly chosen. You must make sure that the ip range is within the
docker interface subnet. You can see your docker subnet via

```shell
$ ip route
default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp4s0 proto dhcp metric 600 
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 
```

This means that you have to ensure that the start/stop ip range
for the load balancer is within the `172.17.0.0/16` subnet. Your
docker subnet may be different. You can run `metallb` manually as
shown below or use the python command shown below. We suggest using
these values since there is a dns name that already points to the
address.

```shell
minikube addons configure metallb
```

If you don't want to configure metallb interactively run the below
bash/python command. This is also used in github actions since
the minikube command does not [provide a non interactive way to
configure addons](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/8283)

```shell
python <<EOF
import json
import os

filename = os.path.expanduser('~/.minikube/profiles/minikube/config.json')
with open(filename) as f:
     data = json.load(f)

data['KubernetesConfig']['LoadBalancerStartIP'] = '172.17.10.100'
data['KubernetesConfig']['LoadBalancerEndIP'] = '172.17.10.200'

with open(filename, 'w') as f:
     json.dump(data, f)
EOF
```

Enable metallb

```shell
minikube addons enable metallb
```

```
  The 'metallb' addon is enabled
```

### Debug your Kubernets cluster 

 [K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal-based UI to manage Kubernetes clusters that aims to 
 simplify navigating, observing, and managing your applications in K8s. 
 K9s continuously monitors Kubernetes clusters for changes and provides 
 shortcut commands to interact with the observed resources becoming a 
 fast way to review and resolve day-to-day issues in Kubernetes. It's 
 definitely a huge improvement to the general workflow and a best-to-have 
 tool for debugging yout Kubernets cluster sessions. 

Installation can be done on a Mac, in Windows, and Linux. Instructions 
for each operating system can be found [here](https://github.com/derailed/k9s). 
Be sure to complete installation to be able to follow along.

By default, K9s starts with the standard directory that is set as the 
context (in this case minkube). To view all the current process press `0`:

**NOTE**
  In some circumstances you will be confronted with the 
  necessity to inspect in your ‘localhost’ any services launched by 
  your cluster. For instance, if your cluster has some problem with the 
  network traffic tunnel configuration it may limit or block the user's 
  access to destination resources over the connection. 

K9s port-forward option `<kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>` allows you to access and interact 
with internal Kubernetes cluster processes from your localhost you can 
then use this method to investigate issues and adjust your services 
locally without the need to expose them beforehand.

### Deploy qhub

```shell
pip install -e .
mkdir -p data
cd data
```

Initialize the `qhub-config.yaml`

```shell
python -m qhub init local --project=thisisatest  --domain github-actions.qhub.dev --auth-provider=password --terraform-state=local
```

Give a password to the default user. For this the example password is
`example-user`. You can generate your own via `python -c "import bcrypt;
bcrypt.hashpw(b'<password>', bcrypt.gensalt())"`. Where you can change
`<password>` to be the password you want. This requires the bcrypt python 
package to be installed. This must be added to the `qhub-config.yaml` in 
the users section shown like below.

```
  users:
    example-user:
      uid: 1000
      ...
      password: '$2b$12$lAk2Bhw8mu0QJkSecPiABOX2m87RF8N7vv7rBw9JksOgewI2thUuO'
      ...
      primary_group: users

```

Render the files from the `qhub-config.yaml`

```shell
python -m qhub render --config qhub-config.yaml -f
```

```shell
python -m qhub deploy --config qhub-config.yaml --disable-prompt
```

To ease development we have already pointed the dns record
`jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev` to `172.17.10.100` so the next step
is optional unless you end up with the load-balancer giving you
a different ip address.

Make sure to point the dns domain `jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev` to
`172.17.10.100` from the previous commands. This can be done in many
ways possibly the easiest is modifying `/etc/hosts` and adding the
following line. This will override any dns server.

```ini
172.17.10.100 jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev
```

Finally, if everything is set properly you should be able to `curl` the JupyterHub Server.
jupyterhub server.

```
curl -k https://jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev/hub/login
```

You can also visit `https://jupyter.github-actions.qhub.dev` in your
web browser.

### Cleanup

```shell
python -m qhub destroy --config qhub-config.yaml 
```

```shell
minikube delete
```

## Cloud Testing

TODO: write docs on cloud testing

Cloud testing on aws, gcp, azure, and digital ocean is significantly
more complicated and time consuming. You should always prefer the
local testing when possible.
